Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that is intended to convey contempt or ridicule. It involves saying something but meaning the opposite, often in a dry or cutting tone. Sarcasm is a type of figurative language and is commonly used in everyday communication, literature, and humor.

In sarcastic statements, the speaker may say something that is directly opposite to what they actually mean, and the context or tone of voice is crucial for the listener to understand the intended meaning. Sarcasm is often used for humor, to mock, criticize, or express dissatisfaction. It can be subtle or overt, and understanding sarcasm often requires a good grasp of context and cultural nuances.

A sarcasm detector is a tool or system designed to identify instances of sarcasm in written or spoken language. The goal of a sarcasm detector is to analyze text or speech and determine whether the intended meaning is different from the literal meaning, indicating the presence of sarcasm.

Developing a sarcasm detector is a challenging task in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Sarcasm often relies on context, tone, and cultural nuances, making it a complex linguistic phenomenon to accurately detect. Researchers and engineers use various approaches and techniques, including machine learning models, sentiment analysis, and contextual understanding, to build sarcasm detection systems.

A sarcasm detector using embeddings is a system that leverages word embeddings, often pre-trained using methods like Word2Vec, GloVe, or embeddings from deep learning models, to identify instances of sarcasm in text. Word embeddings are vector representations of words in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between words.
