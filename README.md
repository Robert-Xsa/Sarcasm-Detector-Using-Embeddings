Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that is intended to convey contempt or ridicule. It involves saying something but meaning the opposite, often in a dry or cutting tone. Sarcasm is a type of figurative language and is commonly used in everyday communication, literature, and humor.

In sarcastic statements, the speaker may say something that is directly opposite to what they actually mean, and the context or tone of voice is crucial for the listener to understand the intended meaning. Sarcasm is often used for humor, to mock, criticize, or express dissatisfaction. It can be subtle or overt, and understanding sarcasm often requires a good grasp of context and cultural nuances.
